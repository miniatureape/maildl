Download photos from a pop or imap server

## Usage

To run the GUI:

`python gui.py`

Or run the imap version as a script:

`python imap.py imaphost username password`

## Warning!

This isn't exactly production software, but it gets the job done.

It will save your credentials in your home folder, which is almost certainly what you don't want. So make sure you delete them.

The pop version deletes messages as it proccesses them.
